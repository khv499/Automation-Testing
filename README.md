# Automation-Testing
Using Selenium web-driver and Jasmine

npm install selenium-webdriver
npm install -g jasmine
As we downloaded jasmine globally, go to its path and add its path to environmental variables with variable name PATH 

npm init
jasmine init => It creates spec folder

To run normal script file use command node fileName.js
To run testing files use command jasmine spec/fileName.js
